Capturing all your ideas in one place is easy with IdeaBox. Want to create a new idea? Simply fill in your title and body, and then select `save` to display your new idea. Have ideas that you *really* like? Make sure to select the `star` at the top of your idea to add it to your very own personalized collection. Looking for an idea, but can't find it? Don't worry! We made finding ideas quick and efficient. Just enter your key words into the `Search Ideas` bar to start filtering through all of your ideas.


### Project Motivation

The IdeaBox project aims to teach developers how the DOM works with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create functional and interactive websites. This project was completed using "driver-navigator" style collaboration: where students work together to write and create code with other students to develop skills that are essential for working in a professional programming environment.
